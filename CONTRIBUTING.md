# How to contribute

First of all, **thanks for contributing**! Here are some guidelines to make it happen in the best way possible.

## Opening an issue

When you open an issue, please be as precise as possible :
- if it's a bug, how can we reproduce it ? On which environment are your running ?
- if it's a feature request, could you give us some examples of what you'd like ?

## Working on an issue

When you start working on an issue, please make it visible as soon as possible by opening a pull request even though 
the problem is not fixed.

## Opening a pull request

When opening a pull request, please change as little code as possible to fix the problem. If you see a way to improve 
the code but that doesn't fit well with what you're doing, please do it in another pull request.

In the description of the pull request, please start with `Closes #XX` where `XX` is the number of the issue you're 
working on and list the work to do by using github's todo list markdown flavor.
Then, while working on it, check it as you go.
Finally, if you want your pull request to be reviewed, please set some reviewers (we'll deal with the assignee :) )
